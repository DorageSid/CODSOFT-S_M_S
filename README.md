# Student Management System

**Description:**

Welcome to the **Student Management System project**. This Java-based application is designed to efficiently manage student records and facilitate administrative tasks.
In this project, I utilized the power of Apache NetBeans IDE and MySQL Workbench to create a robust system for managing student information and academic scores. The system's core functionalities are tailored to streamline administrative tasks while ensuring user-friendly interaction.

#### Prerequisites
Before you get started, ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:
- Apache NetBeans IDE
- MySQL Workbench

External JAR Files: Make sure to add the following JAR files to your project's classpath:
- jcalendar.jar
- mysql-connector-java.jar

## How to Run the Project
#### To run the Word Counter project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
  -  https://github.com/DorageSid/codsoft_task03.git
2. Open the project in Apache NetBeans IDE.

3. Configure the MySQL database connection in the project:
  - Open src/db/MyConnection.java
  - Modify the database URL, username, and password.
4. Import the MySQL database:
  - Open MySQL Workbench.
  - Create a new schema named `students_management`.
5. Build and run the project in Apache NetBeans IDE.

### Usage
- Launch the application and log in as an admin.
- Access the various functionalities outlined above to manage students and scores effectively.
